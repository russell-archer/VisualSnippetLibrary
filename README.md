## App Features
Visual Snippet Library allows you to open-up your Visual Studio code snippet library so you can quickly browse, search, view, edit and create snippets. Each snippet is represented as a tile, with a live-preview of the code. And every code language has a color-coded background, so you can see the most important snippet properties at a glance.

**In February 2013 Visual Snippet Library was a Top-10 App Winner in the Microsoft Windows 8 Creative Bloq App Generator competition!**

* Browse Visual Studio code snippets with at-a-glance code previews
